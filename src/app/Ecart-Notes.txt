   1.Create a new folder E CART
   2.Inside in it Create a new angular project -ng new ecart-frontend
   3.Install 3rd party  libraries
            ->MdBootstrap - npm i mdb-angular-ui-kit

   4.Lazy Loading
     Lazy loading is a technology of angular that allows you to load JavaScript
     components when a specific route is activated. It improves application load 
     time speed by splitting the application into many bundles. When the user 
     navigates by the app, bundles are loaded as needed.

     Lazy loading helps to keep the bundle size small, which helps reduce load 
     times. We must use the class decorator to create an Angular module @NgModule, 
     and the decorator uses a metadata object that defines the module.  

   5.Create a new Module in angular  --here we create product module for 
     implementing Lazy loading
       
       ->ng g m products --route products --module app.module

   6.Create components in lazy loading module (products module)
      ->ng g c products/allProducts
      ->ng g c products/viewProducts
      ->ng g c products/wishlist    
      ->ng g c products/cart   
   7.components that not included in lazy loding module
      ->ng g c header
      ->ng g c footer
      ->ng g c pageNotFound       
   8.Setup path
     
     localhost 4200 - all products => localhost:4200/allProducts
